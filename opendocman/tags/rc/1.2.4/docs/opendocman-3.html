<P>Most of the configuration for OpenDocMan is controlled by a file
name config.php. Below are some of the configurable options in that
file:

<LI>$database - The name of the database used (ex. opendocman)</LI>
<LI>$user - The user that has update/insert/delete permissions
on above database</LI>
<LI>$pass - Password for above user</LI>
<LI>$hostname - The hostname of the database server (ex. db1.mydomain.com)</LI>
<LI>demo - This setting is for a demo installation, where random
people will be all loggging in as the same username/password like
'demo/demo'.</LI>
<LI>authen - Future setting to control other authentication methods.
Currently only MySQL and web-based kerberos authentication is supported.</LI>

<LI>secureurl [On,Off] - Hide the URL contents from prying

outside the Web server root. Make sure the server has permissions
to read/write files in this folder!</LI>
<LI>$allowedFileTypes - This is a list of file types that
will be allowed to be added to the repository. This may need some
tweeking depending on what types of files your users have.</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Administration Editor</A>
</H2>

<P>When a user is set up as an "admin", they will see an admin menu
in the upper right while they are logged in. There are options for
User, Category, Department, and File Management under this menu item.
