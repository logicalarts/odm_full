<LI>Better permission: new design for this page will be both more
straight forward for the user and the programmers. The permission
select boxes are now used to directly specify which user has which
right to the file. Admin needs not to set inheriting rights. When
the admin sets rights to the department, he indirectly set inheriting
rights for all users. Require more testing.</LI>
<LI>Multiple version of document: Instead of overwriting a document
when a new version is added, keep the old versions, so there is a
traceable change path. Revision configuration is in config.php Revision
dir will be created if not. Inside revision folder, for each file,
a folder will be created with their name (e.g 80/ for 80.dat). Inside
80 folder for example, there will files with the naming of format
of 80_x.dat were x is the revision number. User can view these older
revision through details.php</LI>

edit.php. New or old owner can have their rights revolked</LI>
