<H2><A NAME="s6">6. Automated Installation and Upgrade Notes (For Developers)</A></H2>

<P>There is a new folder named &quot;install&quot; which contains
files use by the new script called setup.php. This is an automated
web-based update/installation script. Here is how it works for users:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>The user loads setup.php into their browser. They can either
select the new installation link, or one of the upgrade links.</LI>
<LI>For a new installation:
<OL>
<LI>The user will be prompted to enter a priviledged mysql username
and password. This is for the database creation and grant assignments.
The script will then proceed to install all the necessary data structures
and default data entries for the most current version of ODM.</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI>For updates:
<OL>
<LI>The user will need to find their current version (which comes
from their old config.php), and they would then click on the appropriate
upgrade link. For example, if their version number is 1.0, they would
click on the &quot;Upgrade from 1.0&quot; link. This will apply all
necessary database changes to their current database.</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
</OL>
<P>For developers, when there is a new version release, a few new
files need to be created and a current files modified.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>upgrade_x.php - where x is the release name. This file should
follow the same format as the other upgrade_x.php files and is used
for upgrades only. This should be built from the output of a program
like mysqldiff.pl and is the &quot;diff&quot;erence between the it's
version, and the version before it. </LI>
<LI>Setup.php - add a new function for the new version upgrade (ex.
&quot;do_update_x()&quot;) where x is the release name. 
<OL>
<LI>Inside this new function, you must &quot;include&quot; each previous
upgrade file in succession (see upgrade_10.php for an exmaple, which
is for a user upgrading from 1.0 to the latest). </LI>
<LI>Add a new case statement for the new upgrade call </LI>
<LI>Add a new link to print_intro() for the upgrade function</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI>odm.php - This file should follow the same format as the current
odm.php file, and should contain all the necessary sql commands to
create a new installation based on the latest database schema. </LI>
<LI>database.sql - This should contain the same sql commands as odm.php,
only in a mysqldump format for users that need to manually install
the program for some reason. This can be a mysqldump straight from
the latest database schema.</LI>
</OL>
<P>These files MUST be kept syncronized for each release!
